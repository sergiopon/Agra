E - Problem E
Source file name: triangles.cpp
Time limit: 1 second

You will be given N points on a circle. You must write a program to determine how many distinct equilateral triangles can
be constructed using the given points as vertices.
The figure below illustrates an example: (a) shows a set of points, determined by the lengths of the circular arcs that have
adjacent points as extremes; and (b) shows the two triangles which can be built with these points.

Input
The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains an integer N, the number of points given. The
second line contains N integers Xi

, representing the lengths of the circular arcs between two consecutive points in the circle:
for 1 ≤ i ≤ (N − 1), Xi represents the length of the arc between between points i and i + 1; XN represents the length of the
arc between points N and 1.
The input must be read from standard input.
Output
For each test case your program must output a single line, containing a single integer, the number of distinct equilateral
triangles that can be constructed using the given points as vertices.
Restrictions
• 3 ≤ N ≤ 105
• 1 ≤ Xi ≤ 103

, for 1 ≤ i ≤ N
The output must be written to standard output.
